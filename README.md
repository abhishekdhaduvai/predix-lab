## Pushing to the Cloud

### Create a distribution version

Before you push the application to the cloud, you will need to create a distribution version of your app. This will create an optimized build. You will need to run this command every time before you deploy to the Cloud.

```
npm run build
```

When you're ready to push your application to the Predix cloud, update the manifest.yml file. Change the name of the application to yours and uncomment and add any services you want to bind to your application. Uncomment the clientId and base64ClientCredential and enter the values from your UAA.

```
